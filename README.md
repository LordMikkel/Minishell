# 🐚 Minishell - Advanced Unix Shell Implementation

Minishell is a robust POSIX-compatible command interpreter implementation, developed entirely in C as part of 42 School's advanced curriculum.

This project represents a significant milestone for me [@LordMikkel](https://github.com/LordMikkel) and my partner [@David-dbd](https://github.com/David-dbd): it is our first large-scale collaborative development (10,000+ lines of personal code), designed to delve deep into Unix system architecture, process management, and compiler theory. Unlike basic academic implementations, this shell has been engineered with a focus on user experience (UX), memory stability and optimization, and a scalable AST-based architecture.

## 🔧 1. System Overview & Dependencies

The core has been built to operate with efficiency comparable to lightweight production shells, minimizing external dependencies and maximizing control over system resources.

### Dependencies & Libraries

*   **Libft (Custom Standard Library):** We use our own library (a prerequisite from previous curriculum) that reimplements essential C functions. Not just string handling, but custom implementations of printf, file I/O, and memory management, forming the foundation upon which the shell operates.
*   **Isocline (Modified Fork):** We chose isocline as the command-line engine but performed a strategic fork to adapt it to the needs of a real shell.
    *   **Leak Correction:** We detected and patched an existing memory leak in the original library to ensure impeccable memory usage.
    *   **Signal Compatibility:** We modified the internal behavior so that operating system signal reception interacts correctly with our shell's lifecycle, emulating the native behavior of readline.

## 🏗️ 2. Architecture & Parsing Logic

The data flow follows a strict modular design inspired by modern compiler theory.

### 2.1. The Tokenizer (Lexical Analysis)

User input is processed and converted into a dynamic array of tokens (reallocated as needed). Unlike a simple split, our lexer types each element for the parser:

**Token Types:** WORD, COMMAND, OR (`||`), AND (`&&`), SEMICOLON (`;`), REDIR_INPUT (`<`), REDIR_OUTPUT (`>`), REDIR_APPEND (`>>`), REDIR_HEREDOC (`<<`), ASIGNATION (`VAR=val`), EXPANSION (`$VAR`), SUBSHELL.

### 2.2. Expansion Strategy

We implemented a hybrid expansion strategy:
*   **Safe Expansion:** Expansions that don't alter the command structure are resolved early.
*   **Late Binding:** For variables that could mutate or affect execution, we wait until just before execution to expand them, ensuring data integrity.

### 2.3. Parser & Backtracking (Syntactic Analysis)

We employ a **Recursive Descent Parser** algorithm supported by **Backtracking**.

**Logic:** The parser attempts to build a branch of the linked node tree based on grammatical rules. If it encounters a syntactic inconsistency, the algorithm "backtracks" to try an alternative rule, similar to how programming language compilers operate.

### 2.4. Grammar & Precedence Hierarchy
To handle complex command combinations properly, our Recursive Descent Parser follows a strict priority hierarchy (from lowest to highest binding power). This ensures that operators are grouped correctly without ambiguity:

1.  **Sequence Level (`;`):** The lowest priority. Splits independent commands.
2.  **Logical Level (`&&`, `||`):** Handles conditional execution based on the previous exit code.
3.  **Pipeline Level (`|`):** Connects the output of one process to the input of the next.
4.  **Subshell Level (`( )`):** Detected parentheses trigger a recursive call to the sequence parser within a forked process.
5.  **Command Level:** Grouping of words, variables, and redirections into an actionable command.

This hierarchical approach allows constructs like `(ls | wc) && echo "done"; sleep 5` to be parsed naturally into a coherent tree.

## ⚙️ 3. Core Components: The AST & Execution

![Minishell Main](.img/main.png)

### 3.1. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Builder

The data structure is not linear; it's a binary tree representing the logical hierarchy of the command.

*   **Intermediate Nodes:** Represent flow control (AND, OR, SEMICOLON, PIPE) and redirections (`> file` is treated as a node modifying output).
*   **Subshells:** Parentheses generate subshell nodes that encapsulate a complete sub-tree.
*   **Leaves:** The final commands (COMMAND) reside at the tree's leaves.

this video -> [What Is An Abstract Syntax Tree?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wINY109MG10) can help you to undestand the key concept.

### 3.2. Recursive Executor

The execution engine traverses the AST using a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** strategy:

*   **Sequences:** The semicolon (`;`) is treated as a separator allowing independent sequences within the same logical line.
*   **Conditional Logic:** Evaluates AND/OR nodes based on the exit status of the previous branch.
*   **Isolation:** Upon encountering a SUBSHELL node, the process forks to protect the parent environment.

### 3.3. State Management (`t_shell`)

The entire shell state is managed through a main `t_shell` data structure passed by reference. This structure contains all allocated information necessary for the shell to operate, both on the stack and the heap.

*   **Signal Handling:** Adhering strictly to POSIX and project norms, we use a single global variable exclusively for the reception and transmission of operating system signals.

## ⚡ 4. Features & Capabilities

### Core Features
*   Complete Operators: Pipes (`|`), Redirections, Append, Heredoc.
*   Control Logic: `&&`, `||` and `;`.
*   Process Management: Execution of binaries, scripts, and builtins.

### Bonus Features
We went beyond academic requirements to create a pleasant-to-use tool:

*   **Line Continuation & Balanced Input:** The shell intelligently detects incomplete commands (unclosed quotes, pipes, parentheses) and provides a secondary `>` prompt, allowing users to complete multi-line statements naturally. This mimics the behavior of advanced shells like `bash` and `zsh`.
*   **Local Assignments:** Support for `VAR=value` command (the variable exists only for that command) and temporary assignments in the current shell.
*   **Persistent History:** The shell creates and manages a physical history file, allowing command retrieval from previous sessions.
*   **Smart Welcome:** On startup, the shell detects the user from the environment, greets according to the time of day, and configures the environment.
*   **Session Analytics:** Upon exit (`exit`), it informs the user of the total time spent in the session with a farewell message.
*   **Custom Prompt:** A modern, highly aesthetic prompt that displays:
    *   Current directory (PWD).
    *   User and Hostname.
    *   Harmonized color theme and visual feedback of the last command's status.

## 🧠 5. Technical Complexity

*   **Parsing and Execution Algorithms:** Implementing a parser with backtracking from scratch in C requires extremely meticulous manual handling of the stack and memory to avoid stack overflows or leaks.
*   **Memory Management:** Since C has no Garbage Collector, every token, AST node, and environment variable is managed manually. Cleaning the AST also requires using recursive functions to clear these structures in a controlled manner.
*   **Concurrency & Signals:** Synchronization between the parent process (shell) and children (commands), ensuring signals like Ctrl+C only affect the correct processes (blocking vs non-blocking), was one of the biggest synchronization challenges in the project.

## ♻️ 6. Memory Management Strategy

Since `minishell` is a long-running process, memory leaks are unacceptable. We implemented a two-tier cleaning strategy:

### The `clean_cycle()`
Executed after every command line input (inside the main loop).
* **Restores FDs:** Resets STDIN/STDOUT if redirections altered them.
* **Prunes AST:** Recursively frees the entire Syntax Tree nodes.
* **Wipes Token List:** Frees the dynamic array of tokens for the next prompt.

### The `clean_all()` (Shutdown)
Executed only upon `exit` or fatal error.
* **Free All:** Frees environment variables linked lists, history descriptors, ast nodes, token array and internal shell configurations.
* **Result:** 0 leaks reachable at exit (validated with Valgrind).

### 🧪 7. Testing & Quality Control

To ensure system robustness we tested our Minishell to intensive automated testing using the community-standard [42_minishell_tester](https://github.com/zstenger93/42_minishell_tester). Our customized testing regimen covered everything from basic command execution to edge cases like signal handling, complex pipe chains, and memory leak detection via Valgrind.

###  Test Results Summary
The implementation successfully passed all validation criteria:
* **Mandatory Tests:** ✅ +2566 mandatory tests
* **Bonus Tests:** ✅ +201 bonus tests.
